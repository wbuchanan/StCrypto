# Stata Cryptography Plugin

Started building the plugin in response to a [Statalist posting](http://www.statalist.org/forums/forum/general-stata-discussion/general/1326747-storing-api-keys-in-stata) regarding how to store API keys securely for use in Stata.  Additionally, this would also make it easier and safer to use the [Stata Email](https://github.com/wbuchanan/StataEmail) plugin with a file containing the user's email credentials securely.
